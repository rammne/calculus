                <p>First, start with the Product Rule for differentiation.</p>
                <p>Integrate both sides of the equation to obtain:</p>
                <div class="image-placeholder">Product Rule Image</div>
                
                <p>The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us that if we take the derivative of the integral of a function, then we are left with the original function. The derivative and the integral "cancel" each other out.</p>
                <div class="image-placeholder">Integration Both Sides Image</div>
                
                <p>This is the formula for Integration by Parts:</p>
                <div class="formula">
                    <p>∫u dv = uv - ∫v du</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Just as the Substitution Method could be thought of as the Chain Rule for integration, Integration by Parts could also be thought of as the Product Rule for integration.</p>
                
                <p>When using this formula, we need to choose which part of the integrand (what we are taking the integral of) is u, and which part of it is dv.</p>
                <p>When choosing u and dv, we want to find a u that will be simplified after we take its derivative, and a dv that won't be too complex after integrating it.</p>
                
                <div class="example">
                    <p class="example-title">Example Problem:</p>
                    <div class="image-placeholder">Example 1 Image</div>
                </div>
                
                <p>When choosing for <em>u</em>, remember the preference order "<strong>LIPET</strong>"</p>
                <div class="image-placeholder">LIPET Image</div>
                
                <div class="example">
                    <p class="example-title">Another Example Problem:</p>
                    <div class="image-placeholder">Example 2 Image</div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="example">
                    <p class="example-title">A More Complicated Example:</p>
                    <div class="image-placeholder">Example 3 Image</div>
                    <p>This is called solving for the unknown integral. When we have a product in which both factors never run out of integrals or derivatives, we can solve for the unknown integral by using the <em>Integration by Parts</em> formula repeatedly until the original integral shows up in the problem again.</p>
                    <p>When solving for the unknown integral, it is usually a good idea to stay consistent with your <em>u</em> and <em>dv</em>. That is, if you chose u to be sin x in your first integral, you would want to choose the trig function (in this case cos x) to be u for your following integrals.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="example">
                    <p class="example-title">Final Example:</p>
                    <div class="image-placeholder">Example 4 Part 1 Image</div>
                    <p>Notice that when we choose u and dv the second time, u the second time is du from the first, and dv this time is v from the first time.</p>
                    <div class="image-placeholder">Example 4 Part 2 Image</div>
                    <p>If we were to use Integration by Parts on the last integral we would have:</p>
                    <div class="image-placeholder">Example 4 Part 3 Image</div>
                    <p>Again u this time is du from the previous integral, and dv this time is v from the previous integral. First of all, finishing this integral, we have:</p>
                    <div class="image-placeholder">Example 4 Part 4 Image</div>
                    <p>Now, keep this answer in mind, but let's take a different look at this problem:</p>
                    <div class="image-placeholder">Example 4 Part 5 Image</div>
                    <p>We'll choose the same u and dv as we did the first time, but this time, let's take the derivative of u all the way through and integrate dv for everytime we differentiate u.</p>
                    <div class="image-placeholder">Example 4 Part 6 Image</div>
                    <p>Notice that when we keep taking the derivative of u it eventually goes to 0 and dv never runs out of integrals.</p>
                    <p>If we multiply each u by its respective v and we switch the signs each time we add each part together we get:</p>
                    <div class="image-placeholder">Example 4 Part 7 Image</div>
                    <p>This method is called <strong>tabular integration</strong>. This works when the derivatives of u eventually reach 0 and the integrals of dv never end. This is much quicker than using the formula over and over again.</p>

                <p>Got all that? Good! Let's now move to <strong>Integration Rules:</strong></p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Constant Rule</strong></p>
                        <p>If <em>k</em> is any real number, then the indefinite integral of <em>k</em> with respect to <em>x</em> is:</p>
                        <div class="formula">
                            <p>∫k dx = kx + C</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Coefficient Rule</strong></p>
                        <p>Given any real number coefficient a dn integral function of f:</p>
                        <div class="formula">
                            <p>∫a·f(x) dx = a·∫f(x) dx</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Sum and Difference Rule</strong></p>
                        <p>For integrable functions of f and g:</p>
                        <div class="formula">
                            <p>∫[f(x) ± g(x)] dx = ∫f(x) dx ± ∫g(x) dx</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Power Rule</strong></p>
                        <p>For any real number n, where n ≠ -1, the indefinite integral of x^n is:</p>
                        <div class="formula">
                            <p>∫x^n dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Integration by substitution can be used for a variety of integrals: some products, some compound functions and some quotients. Sometimes we have a choice of method.</p>
                
                <h4 class="section-subtitle">Choosing u:</h4>
                <p>In general, for the types of problems we are concerned with, there are three cases. We choose u to be one of the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>the quantity under a root or raised to a power;</li>
                    <li>the quantity in the denominator;</li>
                    <li>the exponent on e.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Remember that some integrands may need to be rearranged to fit one of these cases.</p>
                
                <h4 class="section-subtitle">Guidelines for u-Substitution</h4>
                <p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Look for some composition <em>f(g(x))</em> within the integrand for which the substitution <em>u = g(x), du = g'(x) dx</em> produces an integral that is expressed entirely in terms of u and du. This may or may not be possible.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 2.</strong> If you are successful in Step 1, then try to evaluate the resulting integral in terms of u. Again, this may or may not be possible.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 3.</strong> If you are successful in Step 2, then replace u by g(x) to express your final answer in terms of x.</p>
                
                <div class="example">
                    <p class="example-title">Example:</p>
                    <div class="image-placeholder">Example 1 Image</div>
                </div>
                
                <p>The chain rule allows us to differentiate a wide variety of functions, but are we able to find antiderivatives for only a limited range of functions? We can sometimes use <strong>substitution</strong> or <strong>change of variable</strong> to rewrite functions in a form that we can integrate.</p>
                
                <div class="example">
                    <p class="example-title">Another Example:</p>
                    <div class="image-placeholder">Example 2 Part 1 Image</div>
                    <p>One of the clues that we look for is if we can find a function and its derivative in the integral.</p>
                    <div class="image-placeholder">Example 2 Part 2 Image</div>
                    <p>Note that this only worked because of the 2x in the original. Many integrals can not be done by substitution.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>As the number of rectangles used to approximate the area of the region increases, the approximation becomes more accurate.</li>
                    <li>It is possible to find the exact area by letting the width of each rectangle approach zero. Doing this generates an infinite number of rectangles.</li>
                    <li>A function and the equation for the area between its graph and the x-axis are related to each other by the antiderivative.</li>
                    <li>The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus enables us to evaluate definite integrals. This empowers us to find the area between a curve and the x-axis.</li>

                <p>Say you have a loaf of bread, and you wanna find out its volume. Since you studied calculus, you know that by slicing the loaf, you can get the slice's volume by multiplying the <strong>area of the slice</strong> and the <strong>thickness</strong> of it.</p>
                <div class="formula">
                    <p>Volume = Area × Thickness</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Of course, lest we get slices infinitely thin, you'd know that we have to integrate that whole thing</p>
                <div class="formula">
                    <p>Volume = ∫ A dt</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Okay, smarty pants. You know how to find the volume of a loaf, congrats. But riddle me this: What happens when you rotate a function?</p>
                <div class="image-placeholder">Rotating a Function Image</div>
                
                <p>It traces a solid shape! Look at it, now we have half of an egg to put on your toast!</p>
                <p>All jokes aside, let's get a bit serious. Finding the volume of slices can be a bit complicated, so let's take a step by step approach here.</p>
                
                <p>If you chop our previous function, and take a slice, you'd get a circle. Thus, the area of a slice would be A= πr²</p>
                <div class="image-placeholder">Sliced Function Image</div>
                
                <p>"But what happened to the earlier formula!?" I hear you ask. Well, we simply substitute the Area into the equation! Since area is πr², then volume is simply...</p>
                <div class="formula">
                    <p>Volume = ∫ πr² dt</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>This is what's called the <strong>Disk Formula</strong>

                <p>Now imagine the dt as dy, radius (r) as x and substitute that x for f(y).</p>
                <div class="formula">
                    <p>Volume = π∫ [f(y)]² dy</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Which is generally the more used version!</p>
                
                <p>Now what if the slice isn't solid, and has a hole in the middle? For cases like this, we use the <strong>Washer Formula</strong></p>
                <div class="image-placeholder">Washer Slice Image</div>
                
                <p>Notice how there's two Rs? Since we're no longer dealing with a solid slice, there's now two circles instead of one. The big R represents the outside circle of the slice and the small r represents the inner circle.</p>
                
                <p>For this holed slice, the area is π(R²-r²), or simply A = π(R²-r²)</p>
                
                <p>Recalling the original formula of volume (<em>VOLUME = ∫ A dt</em>), we can now replace the "A". The result of that substitution will be the washer formula</p>
                
                <div class="formula">
                    <p>Volume = ∫ π(R² - r²) dt</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Same drill as before, let's replace the <em>big (R)</em> with f(x) and the <em>small r</em> with g(x). Do the same with dt being <em>dx</em> and we first get a long string like:</p>
                
                <div class="formula">
                    <p>Volume = π∫ [(f(x))² - (g(x))²] dx</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Then the final form of the <strong>washer formula</strong></p>
                
                <div class="formula">
                    <p>Volume = π∫ [(f(x))² - (g(x))²] dx</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="example">
                    <p class="example-title">Example:</p>
                    <div class="image-placeholder">Example 1 Image</div>
                </div>
                
                <p>And this concludes the disk and washer method! Remember...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rotate</li>
                    <li>Slice</li>
                    <li>Integrate!</li>
